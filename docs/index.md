## Leather & Steel in the California Redwoods

![Leather Shop](assets/img/leathershop.jpg)

ReuterCraft is a one man shop, ran out of half a garage and a remodeled shed in the heart of the Avenue of the Giants in Northern California. I discovered a love for making things working in the Set and Prop dept. while getting a theatre degree from San Francisco State University, where I also met my wife. Covid and having children sent us back to my family home in the beautiful redwoods, where I now life with my wife and our 3 children.
While I primarily focus on custom and stock leather goods, however my skill set is beginning to branch into forging and metal smithing as well.
